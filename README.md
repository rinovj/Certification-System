## [Introduction]()
During this Coronavirus Pandemic, on-site/direct or face-to-face assessments (which were usually done in the past) is now very difficult to do because in general, now a days the (prospective) clients refuse or do not accept physical visits due to the above pandemic reasons.
The implementation of online assessments is currently the only option because it can save and even eliminate costs commonly incurred by current assessment providers (LSPs) such as transportation, accommodation, meals, papers, stationary, PCR and other costs. Not to mention the hassle of the preparation of assessment tools and assessment documents. And the last, the results of the manual, handwritten or offline assessment are very difficult to be used or converted as a database for documentation and archival purposes.

## [The online era]()
The stages of conducting offline assessments, starting from preparation, implementation to the completion of the assessment, are certainly very inconvenient for all personnel involved in this process.
The certification business is the core business of an LSP, of course it requires a powerful, intelligent, and automated "engine" to sustain this business and bring it to its destination faster. An online assessment system is the solution.
